"""Explanation of the pytest Code
Fixtures:

@pytest.fixture: This decorator allows you to create setup code that can be shared across multiple tests. The test_file fixture creates a temporary test file and cleans it up afterward.
Mocking:

We use pytest's simpler syntax for assertions and exception handling.
Tests:

Each test is a separate function decorated with @patch to mock sys.exit and the open function. The logic for each test remains largely the same.
Assertions:

We use assert statements to check conditions, such as ensuring sys.exit is not called or that it raises the correct error."""
